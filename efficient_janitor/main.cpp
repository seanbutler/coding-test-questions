The janitor of a high school is extremely efficient. By the end of each day, all of the
schoolâ€™s waste is in plastic bags weighing between 1.01 pounds and 3.00 pounds. All
plastic bags are then taken to the trash bins outside. One trip is described as selecting
a number of bags which together do not weigh more than 3.00 pounds, dumping them in the
outside trash can and returning to the school. Given the number of plastic bags, and the
weights of each bag, determine the minimum number of trips the janitor has to make.
